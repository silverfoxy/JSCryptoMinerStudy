<p class="text"><br></p>
<p class="text">RISKS INHERENT IN TRADING THROUGH THEINTERNET:</p>
<p class="text"><br></p>
<p class="text">A CFD (contract for difference) trading involves many types of contracts covering a diverse set of markets including shares, indices, commodities and treasuries. </p>
<p class="text"><br></p>
<p class="text">Forex is a de-centralized global market where the world’s currencies are exchanged. </p>
<p class="text"><br></p>
<p class="text">CFD trading and Forex are speculative and involves a high degree of risk and can result in the loss of your entire investment. Therefore, trading in CFD and Forex is appropriate only for persons who understand and are willing to assume the economic, legal and other risks involved in such transactions.</p>
<p class="text"><br></p>
<p class="text">You should be satisfied that CFD and Forex trading is suitable for you in light of your financial circumstances and attitude towards risk. You should not engage in speculative CFD and Forex trading unless you understand the basic aspects of such trading and its risks. If you are in any doubt as to whether CFD and Forex trading is appropriate and suitable for you, please seek independent advice from a financial consulting professional, as  'The Bitcoin Code'  does not provide such advice.</p>
<p class="text"><br></p>
<p class="text">It is the Client’s responsibility, considering his personal circumstances and financial resources, to take particular care and make careful considerations independently, both prior to applying for engaging in Forex and CFD Trading with  'The Bitcoin Code'  and our selected brokers and prior to making any individual order.</p>
<p class="text"><br></p>
<p class="text">Where the Client does not understand the risks involved in applying for a trading account with the Company or in making any individual order, the Client should seek advice and consultation from an independent Financial Advisor. If the Client continues to not understand the risks involved in trading in CFDs and Forex, the Client should not trade at all.</p>
<p class="text"><br></p>
<p class="text">You are advised that the CFDs and Forex offered by our selected brokers are not always traded under the rules of any recognized, designated or regulated exchange.</p>
<p class="text"><br></p>
<p class="text">Consequently, engaging in CFD and Forex trading may expose you to substantially greater risks than investments which are so traded.</p>
<p class="text"><br></p>
<p class="text">The Client must acknowledge that engaging in CFD and Forex poses a great risk of incurring losses and the Client must accept that he is willing to undertake this risk.</p>
<p class="text"><br></p>
<p class="text">LEGAL RESTRICTIONS</p>
<p class="text"><br></p>
<p class="text">Laws regarding financial trading and contracts may be different throughout the world. It is reader’s obligation to ensure that the use of  'The Bitcoin Code'  is fully compliant with any law, regulation or directive applicable in their country of residence.</p>
<p class="text"><br></p>

<p class="text"> 'The Bitcoin Code'  collects and
uses personal information for the following Identified Purposes:</p>

<p class="text">3(a). to understand customer needs
regarding  'The Bitcoin Code' ' services;</p>

<p class="text">3(b). to develop and provide our web
site and our products and services for our customers;</p>

<p class="text">3(c). to fulfill your requests for
products, services or information;</p>

<p class="text">3(d). to communicate with customers and
site visitors, when necessary, and to inform customers of upgrades,
as well as of other products and services available from  'The Bitcoin Code' , its partners and third parties;</p>

<p class="text">3(e). to comply with any applicable
law, regulation, legal process or government request;</p>

<p class="text">3(f). to respond to a legitimate claim,
or to address our reasonable belief, that you are violating the
rights of any third party or any of the agreements or policies that
govern your use of  'The Bitcoin Code'  site or any  'The Bitcoin Code'  product or service;</p>

<p class="text">3(g). to protect the services, products
or rights of  'The Bitcoin Code' , including but not limited to
the security or integrity of  'The Bitcoin Code'  site; and</p>

<p class="text">3(h). to identify and resolve technical

<p class="text"> 'The Bitcoin Code'  also uses
personal information in an aggregate form (i.e., not individually
attributable to you) for its business analysis, operational,
marketing and other promotional purposes. If we hire other companies
to provide some products or services on our behalf, then we will only
provide those companies the personal information they need for the
Identified Purposes, and we will limit their rights to use and
further disclose your personal information as appropriate in the
course of their work for us.</p>

<p class="text">Limiting the collection of personal
information</p>

<p class="text"> 'The Bitcoin Code'  limits its
collection of personal information to only that information which is
necessary for the Identified Purposes.  'The Bitcoin Code'  does
not direct its site to, nor does it knowingly collect any personal
information from children under the age of thirteen.</p>

<p class="text">Disclosure, processing and retention</p>

<p class="text"> 'The Bitcoin Code'  does not
sell, rent or disclose your personal information to anyone else,
except:</p>

<p class="text">5(a). to someone you have designated to
act as your agent, for one or more of the Identified Purposes (listed
in Section 2, above);</p>

<p class="text">5(b). to  'The Bitcoin Code' '
employees, independent contractors, subsidiaries, consultants,
business associates, service providers, suppliers and agents, acting
on  'The Bitcoin Code' 's behalf for any of the Identified
Purposes;</p>

<p class="text">5(c). as necessary if  'The Bitcoin Code'  has reason to believe that disclosure is necessary to
identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be
causing injury to or interference (either intentionally or
unintentionally) with  'The Bitcoin Code' ' rights or property,
other users of  'The Bitcoin Code' ' web site, products or
services, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities; and</p>

<p class="text">5(d). to respond to judicial process
and provide information to law enforcement agencies or in connection
with an investigation on matters related to public safety, as
permitted by law, or otherwise as required by law.</p>

<p class="text">In addition, as we continue to develop
our business, we may sell or buy other businesses or entities, or we
may merge with another company. In such transactions, personal
information may be one of the transferred business assets. Also, in
the event that  'The Bitcoin Code'  or substantially all of its
assets are acquired, your personal information may be one of the
transferred assets. Your information may be stored and processed in
the U.K., or in any other country in which  'The Bitcoin Code' 
or its subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities. By using this web
site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your
country. After your account becomes inactive (that is, if you request
to be removed from our database),  'The Bitcoin Code'  will keep
your personal information in its archives. Your information will then
be used only as necessary for tax reasons or to prove  'The Bitcoin Code' ' compliance with any applicable law.</p>

<p class="text">Accuracy of personal information</p>

<p class="text"> 'The Bitcoin Code'  will use
reasonable efforts to keep customer personal information accurate for
the Identified Purposes, and for minimizing the possibility of making

reasonable efforts to protect customers' personal information.</p>

information held about you. Your right of access can be exercised in
accordance with the Act. Any access request may be subject to a fee
of £10 to meet our costs in providing you with details of the
information we hold about you.</p>

<p class="text">General</p>

<p class="text">If  'The Bitcoin Code'  is not
able to provide access to some aspect of a customer's personal
information, it will provide reasons for denying access such as; that
by doing so would likely reveal personal information about a third
party, or that it is confidential commercial information or
attorney-client privileged communications, or that the information
relates to a breach of an agreement or a contravention of law, or
that its disclosure could reasonably be expected to threaten the life
or security of another individual.</p>

<p class="text">Customers have the right to request
that inaccurate or incomplete information be amended as appropriate,
by contacting  'The Bitcoin Code'  as described above.  'The Bitcoin Code'  will promptly correct such personal information.</p>

                      When I joined The Bitcoin Code 2 months ago, never could have I ever imagined the series of events that would unfold just days after locking in my free software. I was able to clear my $131,382 debt. There is no greater feeling than to be debt-free. Now, I’m in the process of buying my dream home. I still can’t believe this is all really happening…I’m forever grateful to Steve.</div>
