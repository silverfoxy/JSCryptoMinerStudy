            <h3>What could have caused this?</h3>
            <p>During high-traffic product releases we have extra security in place to prevent bots entering our site. We do this to protect customers and to give everyone a fair chance of getting the sneakers. Something in your setup must have triggered our security system, so we cannot allow you onto the site.</p>

            <h3>How can I resolve this?</h3>
            <p>Please try refreshing or accessing our website from a different browser or another device. You could also check if there are any scripts, like ad blockers, running in your browser and disable them. </p>
            <p>If this does not help, the issue might be caused by malware. If you're on a personal connection you can run an anti-virus scan on your device to make sure it's not affected by malware.
