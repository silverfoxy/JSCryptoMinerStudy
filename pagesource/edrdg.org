<H2> Introduction</H2>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Electronic Dictionary Research and Development
Group was established in 2000 within the Faculty of Information 
Technology, Monash University, with the following objectives:
</P>
<OL type="a">
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">the compilation of electronic dictionaries;
</P>
</LI>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">to carry out research and development in
applied computational linguistics with particular emphasis on computer
lexicography.
</P>
</LI>
</OL>
The Group is effectively Jim Breen and collaborators around the world.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Group is currently the home of the "EDICT Project" which has been
operating for many years, and which has led to the compilation of a
number of major Japanese-English dictionary files. The copyright for
these files has been assigned to the Group. 
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The major ongoing projects of the Group are:

</P>
<H2> Usage of the Dictionary Files.</H2>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In March 2000, Jim Breen assigned ownership of the copyright
of the dictionary files assembled, coordinated and edited by him to the
Group, on the understanding that the Group
will foster the development of the dictionary files, and will utilize
all monies received for use of the files for the further
development of the files, and for research into computer lexicography
and electronic dictionaries. Hitherto the files were freely available
for non-commercial use, and restricted from commercial exploitation.
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Following a period during which the files were available for commercial
use on payment of a negotiated royalty, in February 2003 it was decided
to make the files more freely available for use, both commercial and
non-commercial, subject to a number of conditions mainly to ensure
adequate and appropriate acknowledgement.
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At the same time, users of the files who are successful in
using or incorporating the files in a commercial product or service are
requested to make a donation to the Group  commensurate with the benefits
they receive from the files. These donations are used to fund the
maintenance and development of the files and the related activities of the
Group.
