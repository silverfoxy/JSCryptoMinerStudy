        Thank you all for you feedback on the Forbidden Land,
        Eureka Anemos.<br><br>
        After reviewing comments we received from users worldwide,
        we have decided to implement the following changes to
        Eureka lockboxes and their rewards in a hotfix scheduled
        for the end of March.<br>
        - Eureka potions will be added as possible rewards.<br>
        - The rate at which fireworks are awarded will be
        reduced.<br>
        - Various gear, as well as the Wicked Winds Whisper and No
        Quarter orchestrion rolls will no longer be untradable and
        may be put up for sale.<br><br>
        Please be advised that the lockboxes obtained prior to this
        hotfix but opened afterwards will be affected by the above
        changes.

        FFXIV Producer and Director Yoshi-P here.<br>
        I'd like to comment further on the situation surrounding
        the bug which allowed players to execute the squadron limit
        break Ungarmax outside of command missions.<br><br>
        While we reviewed a great deal of information obtained from
        various sources, including social network sites, we found
        much of it was conflicting. Accordingly, we wanted to
        ensure that we made a clear and accurate assessment of the
        circumstances and underlying cause, and from that
        determined what preventative measures could henceforth be
        taken.<br><br>
        Since I wanted to touch on how our conclusions impact our
        development and operations teams, as well as QA and our bug
        reporting flow, this post ended up being extremely long. I
        ask that you set aside sufficient time to read it in full.
        I've also included a timeline and summary to help you all
        understand the situation to this point.<br><br><b><font size="4">- Timeline of Events</font></b><br></p><ul><li><b>Ungarmax is implemented in internal build along with
          command missions for 4.1.</b></li><li><b>Due to action implementation oversight, bug allowing
          usage of Ungarmax outside of command missions is
          introduced.</b></li><li><b>Bug remains undiscovered by development and operations
          teams, and is ultimately pushed live.</b></li><li><b>Bug is discovered by players and is intentionally
          exploited to execute Ungarmax outside of command
          missions.</b></li><li><b>Player executing Ungarmax outside of command missions
          is observed by another player, who reports it three times
          as cheating.</b></li><li><b>Reports of cheating are received by the Special Task
          Force, which begins to monitor the reported player.</b></li><li><b>The STF is unable to confirm the usage of third-party
          tools to facilitate cheating and ceases monitoring the
          reported player.</b></li><li><b>At a later date, the reported player is confirmed to
          have used a third-party tool to cheat and is permanently
          banned.</b></li><li><b>The Ungarmax bug remains unknown to the development,
          operations, and QA teams for an extended period of
          time.</b></li><li><b>On the afternoon of 2/27 JST, information regarding
          the Ungarmax bug is spread by several players aware of
          it.</b></li><li><b>On the evening of 2/27 JST, the development,
          operations, and QA teams commence an investigation and
          discussion as to how to proceed.</b></li><li><b>At 2/28 4 PM JST, the servers are taken down for
          emergency maintenance.</b></li><li><b>Two hours later, at 6 PM JST, the servers are brought
          online and the Ungarmax bug has been addressed.</b></li><li><b>The work flow for the development teams is revised in
          an effort to eliminate similar bugs in the future.</b></li><li><b>The work flow for the STF and operations teams is

      In summary, this bug has been addressed, and Ungarmax should
      no longer be usable in this fashion. Furthermore, in an
      effort to reduce the occurrence of similar bugs, as well as
      to ensure that the reports we receive are afforded all due
      consideration, we have reviewed and revised the process by
      which the STF escalates issues to the development teams, the
      GMs, and the QA teams.<br><br>
      At this time, we are in the final stages of determining what
      disciplinary actions to take against players who
      intentionally and/or repeatedly exploited this bug in order
      to clear content.<br><br>
      This concludes the summary of recent events and our actions
      taken in response.<br>
      The FFXIV team has been and always will be fully committed to
      operating in a fair and open manner. We hope we can continue
      to count on your patronage in the years to come.<br><br><br><br>
      As previously mentioned, what follows is a far longer and
      more detailed explanation of recent events. Should you wish
      to read it in full, I suggest you set aside sufficient time
      to do so.<br><br><b><font size="4">- A Detailed Explanation of the Bug and Our
      Preventative Measures</font></b><br><br>
      To review, the Ungarmax bug is as follows:<br><br><b>Provided certain conditions are met, the squadron limit
      break Ungarmax can be triggered at will outside of command
      missions.</b><br><br>
      The conditions for reproducing this bug are as follows:<br><ul><li><b>Player has unlocked adventurer squadrons</b></li><li><b>Player has unlocked command missions</b></li><li><b>Player has filled at least one level of the limit
          gauge</b></li></ul>When a player attempts to execute a class, job, or
      general action with the keyboard, mouse, or gamepad, several
      things must happen before the action is actually executed and
      processed.<br><blockquote><b><font color="red">1. Action input is registered by
        player client.<br>
        2. Action input is converted to packets and sent from
        player client to server.<br>
        3. Server-side check to determine if action can be executed
        is performed.<br>
        4. If confirmed possible, server-side calculations are
        performed and results are sent to player client via
        packets.<br>
        5. Results packets are received by player client, which
        processes and displays animations, effects, relevant
        figures, and so forth.<br>
        6. If confirmed impossible, input is processed as error and
        results are sent to player client via packets.</font></b></blockquote>As you can see, a successful server check must
      always be performed before an action is permitted to be
      executed. An action input alone should never be sufficient,
      and a sever check that confirms whether or not an action is
      valid is essential to ensuring that cheating is not taking
      place.<br><br>
      However, because the squadron limit break Ungarmax was not
      implemented as part of the battle system by the usual team,
      the normal procedures that ensure such actions are checked by
      the server were not observed. Moreover, the routine requests
      that the server-side checks for all relevant actions be
      aggressively tested by the QA team were insufficient. As a
      result, this exceedingly simple bug went unnoticed and made
      it into the release build. This goes to show how a single
      oversight in a patch containing a plethora of new actions and
      content can have drastic repercussions.<br><blockquote><b>Our Assessment:</b><blockquote>
          In developing and expanding the content of FFXIV, a great
          many individuals had to work in parallel. As a result,
          the minimum standards and procedures for creating new
          actions were neglected, and not all team members were
          sufficiently aware of the importance of ensuring server
          side checks are performed. Additionally, the squadron
          limit break Ungarmax was intended to be an order given to
          your unit members and therefore should not have been
          usable via the /ac macro. These mistakes created a
          situation in which players could easily exploit this bug
          to their advantage.
        </blockquote><b>Our Response:</b><blockquote>
          The battle team, which is responsible for the creation of
          most new actions, will once again share with other teams
          and planners their standard methods and procedures. The
          QA teams will review their guidelines with an eye towards
          performing more stringent checks in the future.<br><br>
          Moving forward, all new actions will be:<br><b><font color="red">1. Tested to ensure server-side
          checks are being processed correctly, regardless of
          intended functionality.<br>
          2. Flagged unusable with /ac macros by default, and added
          to a white list of valid actions only upon further
          review.</font></b><br><br>
          These and other precautions will be taken regardless of
          whether or not formal requests have been received, in
          addition to the standard quality assurance checks to
          ensure that actions are performing to spec. It is our
          belief that by taking such measures to reduce developer
          error that we will prevent the occurrence of similar bugs
          in the future.
        </blockquote></blockquote><br><b><font size="4">- Our Efforts to Ensure Reports of Cheating
      are Properly Processed</font></b><br><br>
      As some of you may be aware, there were claims made on
      external sites that this bug was reported to us four months
      ago. In order to ascertain the truth of the matter, we
      investigated all relevant communications and log data.<br><br>
      Ultimately, we concluded that three reports of cheating were
      made via the support desk between October 15 and 16, 2017.
      All reports were made by the same player regarding the usage
      of Ungarmax by another player in the Royal City of
      Rabanastre, where it should not have been possible.<br><br>
      Although an investigation was opened into these claims, it
      was eventually closed without informing the development or QA
      teams. Because of this, despite the player's reports, the
      bug remained unknown to us for some time. Again, we deeply
      apologize for the resulting problems.<br><blockquote><b>Our Assessment:</b><blockquote>
          The main purpose of the Special Task Force is to
          investigate illicit activities in FFXIV. Manipulation of
          packet data, teleport and speed hacks, RMT, and other
          similar actions that may be considered cheating fall
          within their purview.<br>
          When they received these reports and opened their
          investigation, they did not focus on the possibility that
          the player was exploiting a bug so much as the
          possibility the player was utilizing a new third-party
          tool. Therefore, although they monitored the reported
          player for a time, when they did not observe them using
          any such tools, they closed the investigation. While the
          STF has been instrumental in ensuring that our players
          can enjoy a fair and stable gameplay environment, in this
          instance their specific approach backfired.
        </blockquote><b>Our Response:</b><blockquote>
          Within the FFXIV operations teams, there are two in
          particular that are responsible for resolving in game
          issues. The GMs that you all know comprise one, and the
          STF is the other. After reviewing the various
          responsibilities assigned to both, we have revised the
          overall workflow to ensure that neither group becomes too
          compartmentalized, and to ensure that all reports
          regardless of content are eventually forwarded to the
          development and QA teams. That being said, because this
          change alone will drastically increase the quantity of
          reports received, they will be classified and reviewed as
          priority dictates by the relevant individuals to reduce
          the risk of a report slipping through the cracks.
        </blockquote></blockquote><br><b><font size="4">- Disciplinary Actions to Be Taken against
      Players Who Exploited the Ungarmax Bug</font></b><br><br>
      A great many players, as well as our own development and
      operations teams, learned of this bug after a post was made
      on Reddit. We have since analyzed the battle log data from
      all players on record from the release of 4.1 to the date of
      the aforementioned post, as well as the date when maintenance
      was performed to address the issue. The results are as
      follows:<br>
      (Of reports received, 66 in total came from all regions)<br><br><b><font color="red">- Prior to midnight JST, 2/27, 25
      characters across 21 accounts were confirmed to have used
      Ungarmax in 8-man duties.</font></b><br><blockquote><b>Our Assessment and Response:</b><blockquote>
          The players of these 25 characters were confirmed as
          having exploited the bug prior to knowledge of it
          becoming widespread. Therefore, they not only chose to
          use Ungarmax outside of command missions, but actively
          concealed the existence of the bug allowing them to do so
          from others. Accordingly, their accounts are being
          suspended.
        </blockquote></blockquote><b><font color="red">- After midnight JST, 2/27,
      1110 characters were confirmed to have exploited this bug to
      execute Ungarmax under abnormal circumstances.</font></b><br><blockquote><b>Our Assessment:</b><blockquote>
          Of these 1110 characters, 457 exploited the bug only
          once, and in either public or housing areas, or in
          undersized parties in older instanced content. Given the
          circumstances, we believe these instances were simply
          players seeking to confirm whether or not the bug did
          indeed exist. Of the remaining characters, 523 characters
          used it more than once, albeit only a few times. However,
          130 characters were confirmed to have repeatedly
          exploited this bug. Players will be treated differently
          according to these factors.<br>
          As an additional note, while during our investigation we
          confirmed that several players exploited this bug while
          undertaking the Unending Coil of Bahamut prior to 2/27,
          and one player after, none successfully completed the
          duty.
        </blockquote><b>Our Response:</b><blockquote>
          Players we judge to have exploited this bug not to
          progress through content, but solely out of curiosity,
          will not be subject to disciplinary action. Not only was
          this a major bug that was created by developer error, it
          persisted for months due to our failure to properly
          process user reports, and the resulting usage by curious
          players upon word of it spreading is understandable. Our
          analysis of battle and other log data from the period of
          when information on the bug was disseminated until the
          bug was fixed confirms that these players did not profit
          from its usage, and we see no reason to hold them to
          account. That being said, we must strongly encourage you
          all to not experiment with these bugs in the future, and
          to that end will be sending mails to all concerned.<br>
          Players who exploited this bug more than once, if only a
          few times, will be regarded as having done so
          intentionally, and therefore will be subject to a 24-hour
          account suspension. However, players who exploited this
          bug a significant number of times will be more harshly
          penalized.
        </blockquote></blockquote><br>
      Finally, I would like to deeply apologize to you all yet
      again for the inconvenience this has caused. We are committed
      to doing everything in our power to provide you with a stable
      and enjoyable gameplay experience free of bugs. However, I
      must reiterate that to exploit such a clear and obvious bug
      like this is to violate the terms of service, and ask that
      you not do so.<br><br>
      We hope you will continue to enjoy your time in the world of
      FINAL FANTASY XIV for years to come.

              I don't doubt that Kaposhipi (not sure if I spelled
              it right) is relaying our wishes to the dev team, but
              we get so little real feedback in here that it's like
              a desert. We feel like we give and give and give
              suggestions and receive very little in return. Then
              all of a sudden, changes (like the 4.0 pvp) are
              lumped on us like an avalanche. Now, I grant you, it
              is probably one small step in the overall plan for
              PVP, but we don't know what's on the horizon and
              because we love this game and this mode so much, it's
              really discomforting.

      I just wanted to say that I'm not the only one to relay your

      it's a joint effort by everyone in the NA team and myself -
      Luxpheras, Sicycre, Zhexos and Bayohne have been helping a
      lot with PvP feedback.<br><br>
      Sorry to read you feel like you're receiving very little in
      return of your feedback. We always strive to improve our
      communication, and while we can't promise to satisfy all
      the requests you submit, we will continue to work with the
      dev. teams and the community team as a whole to reflect on
      how we can provide more information to the community when we
      can.<br><br>
      Let me also add that we unfortunately cannot respond to all

        Greetings!<br><br>
        Thank you all for the extensive feedback and input offered
        on dark knight. Please rest assured that your thoughts have
        been gathered and forwarded to the dev. team, and we will
        continue to share your feedback as it comes.<br><br>
        It's also worth noting that we understand that as a
        community, it's important that you feel your voices are
        heard. While we cannot respond to every thread that we
        review and pass on, please know that we have community
        representatives (myself included!) who read through the
        official forums and report player feedback to the
        development team on a daily basis.<br><br>
        This means that oftentimes, your feedback is being actively
        shared and you might not know it. We'd love to be able to
        respond to every thread we read and share with the dev.
        team but the volume of feedback received and the nature of
        operating as a global community makes that unrealistic to
        achieve. I know that Kaposhipi has mentioned this before,
        but a lot of the work our teams do happens behind the
        scenes and we are often not at the liberty to discuss plans
        that are still in development.<br><br>
        With that being said, we will continue to try our best to
        keep the community up to date with the latest information
        and comment when we can. Please continue to share your
        feedback, thoughts and experiences with us, and we'll keep
        sharing it with the dev. team!

              This is Naoki Yoshida, Producer and Director of
              FFXIV.<br>
              Allow me to provide updates on the current situation
              here.<br><br>
              There is various other information on external
              websites that is causing confusion, but it was in
              fact late last night (Japanese time) that the
              development team “ myself included “ learned of
              this bug, in the same way as many others did.<br><br>
              Regardless of how and why, at the same time as
              confirming the truth of what is written on the other
              websites, we consider this a highly urgent bug and
              made preparations to fix it promptly. That was what
              the Emergency Maintenance earlier was for. Apologies
              that the information as to why was delayed.<br><br>
              The bug has been fixed, and the action is no longer
              usable in content other than what it is meant
              for.<br>
              We are currently continuing to communicate with the
              NA and EU teams as there is an issue with time
              difference, but are proceeding accordingly to confirm
              the below points:
              <ul><li><b><font color="red">Whether or not the comment
                  written on the external website reporting that
                  "it was reported to the GM team four months ago"
                  is true or not.</font></b></li><li><b><font color="red">If it was, then why was the
                  issue not reported accordingly back
                  then.</font></b></li><li><b><font color="red">Identify the amount of
                  characters that are "assumed to have
                  intentionally used" this action for incorrect
                  means.</font></b></li></ul><br>
              The bug, that has now been fixed, could have occurred
              accidentally by the incorrect use of a macro that had
              been put in place for the standard use of the action
              in some exact conditions if they were met by chance.
              Therefore, we will be careful in our decision as to
              who used it deliberately.<br><br>
              In order for the research into this to be done,
              keeping in mind the issue of time difference, we ask
              for your time and patience on this.<br><br>
              We will be in touch upon gathering and summing up the
              necessary information, including what needs to be
              done going forward to prevent this issue occurring
              again.<br><br>
              We sincerely apologize for this bug and the time
              taken to fix it.<br>
              Thank you for your patience until we send the next
              notification on this matter.

            Q: On the day of patch release, it was difficult to
            participate in instanced battles due to congestion.<br>
            Are you planning for any counter-measures to mitigate
            the congestion, such as moving instanced battles to the
            end of the quest series?
          </div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></div>A: We apologize that we had to undergo emergency
      maintenance on the day of the patch release.<br><br>
      In Patch 4.0 there was a similar issue with instanced battle
      congestion, and to players it may have seemed that the same
      issue was being repeated. We had measures in place for Patch
      4.2 based on our previous experience; unfortunately, due to
      human error, there were congestion issues with instanced
      battles again.<br><br>
      Instanced battle quests are intended to provide additional
      immersion into the story, so we would like to carefully
      examine where in the scenario the battles should take place.
      We will also continue to take measures against congestion so
      that players will be able to participate in the instances on
      the day of patch release.<br><br><div class="bbcode_container"><div class="bbcode_quote"><div class="quote_container"><div class="bbcode_quote_container"></div><a href=

            Q: While there were adjustments for all three tank
            jobs, we still think that paladin is the most efficient
            of the three. Will there be increases to warrior and
            dark knight's support abilities and DPS?
          </div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></div>A: Party supporting abilities are a part of the job's
      identity, so we won't make adjustments that will allow
      using actions with similar effect across all jobs.<br><br><div class="bbcode_container"><div class="bbcode_quote"><div class="quote_container"><div class="bbcode_quote_container"></div><a href=
            "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeLHBU_Xaaw&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=405"
            target="_blank">0:06:45</a><br>
            Q: The adjustment made to dark knight's The Blackest
            Night ability was nice; however the effects of Dark
            Passenger and Shadow Wall feel low compared to the MP
            cost and length of the recast time. I would like to see
            dark knight's defensive properties expanded.
          </div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></div>A: Since the major adjustments to warrior, the
      development team has received requests to adjust dark
      knight.<br><br>
      Looking at the usage rates of each job within the tank role,
      we believe that the balance between them is currently quite
      even, so we are carefully considering how we should adjust
      dark knight.<br><br>
      Content is balanced around the recast time of buffs, so a
      reduction in recast time may not always lead to strengthening
      the job.<br><br>
      Dark knight is under careful consideration at the moment, so
      please wait a bit longer.<br><br><div class="bbcode_container"><div class="bbcode_quote"><div class="quote_container"><div class="bbcode_quote_container"></div><a href=
            "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeLHBU_Xaaw&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=502"
            target="_blank">0:08:22</a><br>
            Q: For tank accessories, it seems much more useful to
            meld Direct Hit onto the new crafted accessories than
            using accessories obtained from the new tokens and
            Savage raid. Are there any plans to adjust the stats on
            the accessories in the future?
          </div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></div>A: We believe the issue here is that the first groups
      of players trying to complete the raids quickly are in favor
      of pushing their DPS. Also, by the time players are able to
      obtain Savage accessories, their item level would probably
      have increased, so at that point, it's up to the individual
      to consider to continue using DPS-focused gear.<br><br>
      We have received some suggestions that tanks should not
      receive any effects from Direct Hit. We understand the
      sentiment on this will be split, so we are carefully
      discussing this at the moment.<br><br><div class="bbcode_container"><div class="bbcode_quote"><div class="quote_container"><div class="bbcode_quote_container"></div><a href=

            target="_blank">0:09:47</a><br>
            Q: Do you have any plans to buff or provide support
            abilities for jobs that didn't receive any
            adjustments in Patch 4.2 such as samurai and red mage?
          </div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></div>A: We have no plans to make any adjustments to red mage
      at this time. We believe increasing red mage's DPS while
      retaining its current abilities would cause a disruption to
      balance.<br><br>
      Since the buffs to monk, players have been asking for some
      sort of buff to samurai. Keeping in mind the concept of the
      job, instead of adding party support abilities, we are
      considering an increase in samurai's personal DPS.<br><br><div class="bbcode_container"><div class="bbcode_quote"><div class="quote_container"><div class="bbcode_quote_container"></div><a href=
            "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeLHBU_Xaaw&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=646"
            target="_blank">0:10:46</a><br>
            Q: After the recent changes, black mage became much
            smoother to play!<br>
            Some party support abilities would complete the
            adjustment, are there any plans to add any or make
            adjustments to do this?
          </div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></div>A: We believe everyone is very focused on their main
      job right now. However, we're making sure that each job
      feels different to play, so we do not have any plans to add
      any new support abilities to black mage in the 4.x series. As
      with samurai, we believe jobs with high DPS are supporting
      their party by dealing high damage.<br><br>
      Also, there seems to be a trend where players believe they
      are at a disadvantage when there is a certain job in the
      raid. There won't be a major advantage or disadvantage no
      matter what setup you have. This type of trend gives a
      negative impression to specific jobs. We would appreciate if
      the community would stop being swayed by this trend.<br><br><div class="bbcode_container"><div class="bbcode_quote"><div class="quote_container"><div class="bbcode_quote_container"></div><a href=

            target="_blank">0:13:04</a><br>
            Q: Do you have plans to add a system that would allow
            glamour stored in the dresser to be used through the
            previous glamour method without the use of a plate?
          </div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></div>A: We are currently receiving many calls from players
      saying they converted the wrong gear. Converted items are not
      gone completely, they can still be used as glamour. You will
      be unable to equip them, but if you are using the item for
      glamouring purposes only, then it's safe to convert them
      into glamour.<br><br>
      We may change or adjust how converted items cannot be used as
      normal gear; however, it may affect inventory size, so we
      haven't decided on this yet.<br><br>
      We're also developing a system that'll allow glamouring
      directly using the items stored inside the dresser.<br><br><div class="bbcode_container"><div class="bbcode_quote"><div class="quote_container"><div class="bbcode_quote_container"></div><a href=
            "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeLHBU_Xaaw&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=985"
            target="_blank">0:16:25</a><br>
            Q: Do you have any plans to increase the amount of
            items that can be stored inside the glamour dresser, or
            add more glamour plates?
          </div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></div>A: Adding more glamour plates is possible, but it would
      increase the amount of data passing through the network,
      which would increase the chances of the servers going down.
      If we are to increase the number of glamour plates, there is
      a need for us to carefully look at everyone's data.<br><br>
      We also have to choose between increasing the areas in which
      the plates can be applied, and increasing the amount of
      plates. At the moment we're currently looking to increase
      the number of plates available, but we would like to slowly
      increase the areas where plates can be applied as well. We
      will be looking at player comments to determine the balance
      between the two.<br><br><div class="bbcode_container"><div class="bbcode_quote"><div class="quote_container"><div class="bbcode_quote_container"></div><a href=

            target="_blank">0:19:14</a><br>
            Q: Would it be possible to add optional items, such as
            Yda or Aymeric's outfit to the armoire or Calamity
            Salvager?
          </div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></div>A: Calamity Salvagers check the character's
      achievements for reclaimable items, so it would be difficult
      to include optional items as they do not have achievements
      tied to them.<br><br>
      As such, we're looking to address this via the armoire, but
      as this requires changing item data, this will take some
      time. Please wait a bit more.<br><br><div class="bbcode_container"><div class="bbcode_quote"><div class="quote_container"><div class="bbcode_quote_container"></div><a href=

            Q: The dye information is lost when storing items in
            the armoire, making it hard to store items that are
            dyed rare colors. Would it be possible to retain the
            dye information for items stored inside the armoire?
          </div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></div>A: In order to store as many items as possible in the
      armoire, we conserve space by cutting down on as much stored
      item data as possible. By including dye data, the amount of
      data required increases dramatically, and so we have no plans
      to address this at the moment. We will instead be increasing
      the amount of items that can be stored in the armoire.<br><br><div class="bbcode_container"><div class="bbcode_quote"><div class="quote_container"><div class="bbcode_quote_container"></div><a href=

            Q: To accommodate new players, cutscenes in Castrum
            Meridianum and The Praetorium main scenario dungeons
            cannot be skipped now. Are there any other dungeons or
            trials that are scheduled to be adjusted like this?
          </div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></div>A: We stopped including cutscenes within content, so we
      don't feel we need to make further changes. Alliance raids
      may be adjusted in some fashion. We feel that the rewards for
      Castrum Meridianum and The Praetorium aren't balanced
      enough, so we're planning to enhance the rewards.<br><br><div class="bbcode_container"><div class="bbcode_quote"><div class="quote_container"><div class="bbcode_quote_container"></div><a href=

            Q: In the Jade Stoa (Extreme), there's a strategy
            where you use tank limit break to ignore the second
            Roar of Thunder, but did the dev. team plan for this
            strategy?
          </div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></div>A: We did not foresee this. Like the meteor phase in
      the Second Coil of Bahamut “ Turn 4, we are happy that
      players have found a strategy that even the dev. team did not
      foresee to cleanly solve the mechanic.<br><br>
      However, if you're going to use tank limit break in the
      Jade Stoa (Extreme), we recommend to discuss with your group
      beforehand.<br><br><div class="bbcode_container"><div class="bbcode_quote"><div class="quote_container"><div class="bbcode_quote_container"></div><a href=

            Q: How do you feel about the current progression of
            Omega: Sigmascape compared to what was originally
            assumed by the development team?
          </div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></div>A: Many more players than expected cleared Omega:
      Deltascape (Savage), and we are seeing the amount of players
      who are participating in Omega: Sigmascape (Savage) has also
      increased. We're streaming during the second week of its
      release and there seemed to be many players who were working
      on clearing Savage v3.0. Please enjoy the content at your own
      pace, and don't feel rushed to clear.<br><br><div class="bbcode_container"><div class="bbcode_quote"><div class="quote_container"><div class="bbcode_quote_container"></div><a href=

            Q: For the Marid mount that can be obtained through the
            Ananta beast tribe quests, could you add an effect to
            the feet while in the air, to emphasize that it's
            flying, similar to the Fenrir mount?
          </div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></div>A: Personally, I wanted some sort of effect as well.
      However, due to the amount of resources required, adding
      effects to all flying mounts would lower the amount of mounts
      we can implement. It will be difficult to take on all
      requests, but I will put in some feedback regarding the
      Marid.<br><br><div class="bbcode_container"><div class="bbcode_quote"><div class="quote_container"><div class="bbcode_quote_container"></div><a href=

            tribe quests, which made it really fun.<br>
            I'm looking forward to the next beast tribe quest
            series, but will we see Namazu or Lupin?
          </div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></div>A: The next beast tribe will be Disciples of the
      Land/Hand specific.<br>
      While I can't go into specific details just yet, popular
      characters will be involved and we believe it'll be
      exciting. You may see some characters that were involved in

            Q: In Triple Triad, even if we're able to collect
            rare cards, because there are limitations for the card
            set up, we are limited in the cards we can use. Would
            you consider easing up on these limitations?
          </div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></div>A: We're discussing how to ease up on the
      limitations.<br>
      We haven't decided when to implement adjustments, so please

            making tabs for each type, to make it easier to find
            the minion!

      we're considering some type of adjustment.<br>

            Q: You're able to participate in the Fashion Report
            from level 15, but is it possible to get a high score
            with just low level gear?
          </div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></div>A: It's not always necessarily possible to get a high
      score at lower levels. It's not suitable for everyone, but
      we implemented Fashion Report as means for players to want to
      start glamouring.<br><br>
      In terms of MGP rewards, you may think there's no reason to
      get higher than 80 points, but for new players who just
      started their adventure, we would like them to feel that
      they'll be able to enjoy glamouring as their levels
      increase.<br><br>
      As a side note, there were three players who were able to get
      a perfect score of 100 for the first week's theme.<br><br><div class="bbcode_container"><div class="bbcode_quote"><div class="quote_container"><div class="bbcode_quote_container"></div><a href=

            Q: it's become difficult to complete various
            large-scale FATEs because the number of participants
            has decreased. Do you have any plans to give incentives
            to players by adding rewards, or adjusting the strength
            of the boss?
          </div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></div>A: We believe adding rewards would make players feel
      that they need to complete the same objectives again, so we
      are planning to make adjustments to their strength.<br><br><div class="bbcode_container"><div class="bbcode_quote"><div class="quote_container"><div class="bbcode_quote_container"></div><a href=

            Q: When will fishers receive a new secondary tool?
            Compared to other Disciples of the Land, their stats
            are lower because of the secondary tool. I'm looking
            forward to a secondary tool with strong stats.
          </div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></div>A: We balance fishers without including the stats on
      the secondary tool.<br>
      Also, the durability of the secondary tool will also drop
      while fishing, so to compensate for this, we have added
      GP.<br><br><div class="bbcode_container"><div class="bbcode_quote"><div class="quote_container"><div class="bbcode_quote_container"></div><a href=

      For those of you playing a healer job, we ask you to
      resurrect any KO'd players you may come across. However,
      for those of you playing solo, the field is pretty large, so
      if you are KO'd in deep parts of the field by yourself, it
      may be hard for other people to rescue you.<br><br><br>
      During the broadcast, we showed some of the details covered
      in previous slides using live gameplay in the fields of
      Eureka.<br><a href=

        You'll also find an Aetheryte in Eureka.
        </li><li>You will not be able to ride any mounts until you
        complete your exploration.
        </li><li>In order to make it easier to play solo, there are
        shops that sells items which may be useful during battles
        in the area.
        </li><li>By targeting a monster, you'll be able to check their
        element. In addition, the Magia board will display the
        element strong against that enemy offensively and
        defensively.
        </li><li>Spinning the Magia board will allow you to switch your
        elemental affinities. There is a cost required to rotate
        the board, but that cost will be recovered over time. You
        can also recover this cost by touching the Magia melder
        located at the base.
        </li><li>Furthermore, the Magia melder can adjust how many
        Magicites are assigned to each attribute. You'll need to
        decide how you would like to distribute the Magicite
        carefully based on your own role, number of party members,
        and their structure.
        </li><li>Notorious monsters may appear under certain conditions
        and these monsters will drop rare items. The contribution
        to the fight works the same way as FATEs so all players
        participating in the fight will receive the right to obtain
        a reward.
        </li><li>Assigning yourself the looking for party status,
        others will be able to search for you through the player
        search feature. You can use it to seek players with similar
        elemental levels as yourself on the spot.
        </li><li>Monsters within Eureka are very tough, and it'll be
        important to think of elemental relationships during
        battle. Compared to monsters encountered outside of Eureka,
        monsters within Eureka will follow you for a much longer
        distance, so it'll be very difficult to shake them off.

            Q: I would like to know the lyrics for the Jade Stoa.
          </div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></div>A: The lyrics were written by the Lore team, Oda for
      the Japanese lyrics, and Michael-Christopher Koji Fox wrote
      the English lyrics.<br><br><a href=

            Q: I really liked the arranged version of the FFVI
            songs featured in Omega: Sigmascape. Could you let us
            know what kind of difficulties you had, or anything you
            were particular about?
          </div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></div>A: There are many arranged songs in FFXIV, but I
      believe it's much more difficult to arrange a song than
      making a new one. For Sigmascape, we're using songs from
      FFVI, but we had to look into the time it took for the battle
      to see how long the song should be arranged for. We also made
      sure to make the songs true to their original versions, while
      arranging it to match the current generation.<br><br><div class="bbcode_container"><div class="bbcode_quote"><div class="quote_container"><div class="bbcode_quote_container"></div><a href=

            Q: I like the song which plays in the Ananta beast
            tribe quest. What did you have in mind when creating
            this song?
          </div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></div>A: My colleague composed that song. I believe they are
      excellent melody makers.<br><br><div class="bbcode_container"><div class="bbcode_quote"><div class="quote_container"><div class="bbcode_quote_container"></div><a href=

            Q: Is that actually the sound of a steam whistle used
            by the Phantom Train in Sigmascape V1.0?
          </div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></div>A: When we use a real sound, we use a company that
      specialize in recording sounds from real life. For the
      Phantom Train, the actual whistle sound was used. We combined
      several whistles together. Not only for this sound, but
      whenever we use sounds from real life, the staff from the
      Sound Editing team makes adjustments to them to match the
      game.<br><br><div class="bbcode_container"><div class="bbcode_quote"><div class="quote_container"><div class="bbcode_quote_container"></div><a href=

            Q: When are you planning to release the Stormblood
            soundtrack? I'm looking forward to it!
          </div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></div>A: I has been six months since Patch 4.0 was released,
      but during that time we continued to develop the soundtrack.
      I believe we can make it sometime this summer; however,
      there's so much in there that it won't fit in one disc
      already, so we're currently looking into ways to keep it as
      a single disc. We'll be sure follow-up on this once we have
      the release date, so please wait just a bit longer.<br><br><div class="bbcode_container"><div class="bbcode_quote"><div class="quote_container"><div class="bbcode_quote_container"></div><a href=

            Q: I would like to play 4.0 songs with a piano. Do you
            have plans to release the piano score?
          </div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></div>A: So far we've released two piano scores for FFXIV,
      but they're sold out and hard to get. The demand for them
      has increased since we introduced the Performance feature, so
      we decided to restock them. The music sheets are made so
      it's easy for those who are beginners or intermediates, so
      I believe it should be easy to use with the Performance
      feature.<br><br><div class="bbcode_container"><div class="bbcode_quote"><div class="quote_container"><div class="bbcode_quote_container"></div><a href=

            Q: I like the Metal song from Alexander. Do you have
            plans to add hard rock songs similar to this one in
            future trials and raids?
          </div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></div>A: That's really dependent on the type of
      content.<br><br><div class="bbcode_container"><div class="bbcode_quote"><div class="quote_container"><div class="bbcode_quote_container"></div><a href=

            Q: What are your musical roots? Who is your favorite
            musician?
          </div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></div>A: I'm not sure about the roots, but both my parents
      were into music, so it's probably from there. As for my
      favorite musician, I like Rage Against the Machine. Recently
      I've been listening to Cymbals, and various other music. I
      love rock music, and love classical music as well.<br><br><div class="bbcode_container"><div class="bbcode_quote"><div class="quote_container"><div class="bbcode_quote_container"></div><a href=

            Q: Please let me know if you have plans to change any
            of the other existing mount music. Also, do you have
            plans to add more variations for the general mount
            music?
          </div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></div>A: I understand there's a request to change the BGM
      from the general songs, but for mounts that may have split
      opinions on which BGM to use, we use the general one. We'll
      continue to consider changing the BGM based on everyone's
      feedback, but the amount of data we can apply to mount BGM is
      also becoming very tight, so please understand that it'll
      be difficult to answer all the requests.<br><br><div class="bbcode_container"><div class="bbcode_quote"><div class="quote_container"><div class="bbcode_quote_container"></div><a href=

            Q: I loved the orchestra concert! Do you have plans to
            do a live concert for the PRIMALS as well?
          </div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></div>A: We'll be releasing our very first CD album The
      PRIMALS and we'll be going on a live tour in Japan, and
      also planning one in Seoul, Korea.<br><br>
      The Eorzean Symphony orchestra concert for our North American
      and European players have been finalized as well! The concert
      will be held in Los Angeles, California, and Dortmund,
      Germany. For Los Angeles, we'll be performing at the Dolby
      Theatre known for hosting the Academy Awards!<br><br><a href=

        We challenged adventurers across the realm to share the
        love this Valentione season and express their affections
        towards their favored NPC in the form of a love letter.
        They say all is fair in love and war, so it's no surprise
        that our Warriors of Light have just as much talent in
        their hearts as they do on a battlefield. Wait¦ don't
        they also say love is a battlefield? How fitting!<br><br>
        It was a pleasure reading through these letters like a nosy
        postmoogle, and we'd like to thank everyone for their
        participation.<br><br>
        Without further ado, we're pleased to announce the
        winners of the Be My Valentione! Creative Writing

        do a live concert for the PRIMALS as well?<br><br>
        A41: We'll have our very own CD album! (We haven't had
        a CD release yet!) We also have plans to do a Zepp tour.
        Ticket sales will begin after the show, from midnight JST.
        (First come, first served basis for reservations)
        Afterwards, the lottery based reservation will begin

        Q40: Thanks for changing the music for the Alte Roite
        mount! Please let me know if you have plans to change any
        of the other mount music. Also, do you have plans to add
        more variations for the general mount music?<br><br>
        A40: I understand there's a request to change the BGM
        from the general ones, but for those that may have split
        opinions on which BGM to use, we use the general one.<br><br>
        The amount of data we can apply to mount BGM is also
        becoming very tight, so it would be difficult to answer all
        the requests, but we're considering them based on
        everyone's feedback, so please be sure to let us know!

        Q39: (Question for Soken) What are your musical roots? Who
        is your favorite musician?<br><br>
        A39: I'm not sure about the roots, but both my parents
        were creating music, so it's probably from there. As for
        my favorite musician, I like Rage Against the Machine and
        Cymbals. I love rock music and I love classical music as
        well.

        Q37: I would like to play 4.0 songs with a piano. Do you
        have plans to release the piano score?<br><br>
        A37: So far we've released two piano scores for FFXIV,
        but they're sold out and hard to get. The demand for them
        have increased since we introduced the Performance feature,
        so we decided to restock on them.<br><br>
        The music sheets are made so it's easy for those who are
        beginners or intermediate, so I believe it should be easy
        to use with the Performance feature.

        We're trying hard to make it fit in one disc.

        Q35: The steam whistle sound used by the Phantom Train from
        Sigmascape V1.0, is that the real sound?<br><br>
        A35: Many of the sounds in FFXIV are recorded by a company
        that records sounds from real life. The whistle sound is
        the actual sound, and we combined several whistles together
        for the effect.

        Q33: I really liked the arranged versions of the FFVI songs
        featured in Omega: Sigmascape. Could you please let us know
        what kind of difficulties you had, or anything you were
        particular about?<br><br>
        A33: This was much more difficult than making a new song.
        We had to look into the time it took for the battle to see
        how long the song should be arranged for.<br><br>
        We made sure to make the songs true to their original
        versions, while arranging it to match the current
        generation.

        Q31: In the past you mentioned that when you made the music
        for Costa Del Sol, you put some breath mints inside an
        empty cup noodle container and shook that to make the
        sound. I would like to know if there were any other unique
        stories similar to this one!<br><br>
        A31: From 4.0, there have been lots of tribal-like
        instruments, and there's an NPC in Azim Steppe that is
        playing the matouqin. For this sound I used an old Japanese
        stringed instrument called kokyu and tweaked the sound a
        bit.

        Q30: Would it be possible to play old FF games from the toy
        box?<br><br>
        A30: Systematically it may not be impossible; however,
        there are rights related matters, so I cannot promise
        anything, but will look into this.<br><br>
        Personally, I would like to do something for game titles
        such as Return to Ivalice, which are hard to play on
        current systems.

        content to use with group pose?<br><br>
        A29: If you're asking to load the locations you visited
        in the past as a background, we currently have no plans for
        this; however, we would like to make it possible to add
        locations that you were able to visit only once.

We thank you for your understanding regarding the necessity of these restrictions.<br><br>Based on our analysis of login numbers and plot sales across all Worlds in the weeks following the release of 4.2, we have decided to implement the following changes during the next scheduled maintenance:<br><br><strong><span class="mdl-color__notes">- Restrictions on all currently designated Congested Worlds will be lifted.</span></strong><br><strong><span class="mdl-color__notes">- New Preferred Worlds will be designated.</span></strong><br><strong><span class="mdl-color__notes">- The moratorium on plot sales to individuals will be lifted.<br></span></strong><br>The prolonged restrictions placed on Congested Worlds, while greatly inconvenient for those affected, have nevertheless proven effective in ensuring a more balanced population distribution across all Worlds. Now that that balance has been achieved, we will be removing these restrictions for a time.<br><br>Moreover, in the hopes of preserving this population distribution, we will continue to designate Preferred Worlds in order to spur population growth.<br><br>Please understand, however, that should we determine certain Worlds are receiving a disproportionate influx of new characters via transfer or creation, we may have no choice but to designate them Congested Worlds and implement restrictions.<br><br>The moratorium placed on private plot sales in conjunction with the addition of new plots has, as we anticipated, allowed a great many free companies to purchase plots and reduce the overall disparity between them. In light of these results, we plan to lift the moratorium on private sales and permit individuals to purchase plots once more.<br><br>As previously announced, private plot sales will be restricted to one plot per World on any given service account. For more information, please refer to our <a href="http://sqex.to/z4h" target="_blank">additional plots and purchasing guide</a>.</p><p class="mdl-text__xs-m16 mdl-space--md">Date &amp; Time: February 19th, 11:00 PM to February 20th, 2:00 AM (PST)<br><span class="mdl-color__notes">* Please note that the duration is subject to change.</span></p><p class="mdl-text__xs-m16">We thank you again for your cooperation and understanding, and hope you will continue to enjoy your time in the world of FINAL FANTASY XIV!</p></div></div></div><div class="home-news-bottom-container"><div class="home-news-topic-img"><img src="https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/t/14991fe0cc0510951cac27eb0ea61b288ce7fdb0.png" width="500px"></div><div class="home-news-post"><div class="home-news-title highlight">The Wolves’ Den – The EU PvP Stream Archive Is Up</div><div class="home-news-info"><a href="http://na.finalfantasyxiv.com//lodestone/topics/detail/14991fe0cc0510951cac27eb0ea61b288ce7fdb0" target="_blank">Visit News Post</a>
