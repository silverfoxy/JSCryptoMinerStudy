This act placed a stamp duty, or tax, on legal papers, newspapers, pamphlets, and even playing cards in Colonial America. Vehement opposition by the Colonies resulted in the repeal of the act in 1766. This was followed by in 1767 by the Townshend Acts which were a series of Laws passed by the British Parliament placing new duties, or taxes, glass, lead, paints, paper and tea imported by the colonists.
