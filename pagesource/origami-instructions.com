			  <p>Did you know that origami came from the Japanese words &quot;Oru&quot; meaning &quot;to fold&quot; and &quot;kami&quot; meaning &quot;paper&quot;? And that's exactly what we do here - fold paper! </p>
			  <p>There's nothing quite like the joy you get from transforming a plain square piece of paper into a container, animal, flower, etc.</p>
			  <p> It still puts a smile on our faces when we complete an origami! </p>

                      <em>Hello, I was a complete beginner to Origami before I came across your website, and successfully used your excellent instructions to create an easy elephant, a shark, a bat, and then a heron within a couple of hours! So, I'd like to say thanks very much, creating some impressive Origami animals was a nice relaxing diversion, surprisingly fun and satisfying.

                      <em>First off i just want to say that i LOVE your site! I haven't found a site with this good of origami instructions yet! I love that you have step-by-step instructions and photos to go along. The photos help me a TON! If i don't understand the instructions i can just look a the picture to help me along. I never thought I could do origami and I never even thought about trying. I thought that origami would be too hard for me, but since i found this site I realized that is so untrue! Ever since I found this I have been making origami and the assortment is growing by the week! I could write about how much I love this site forever but I think this is enough. I hope you keep on adding new origami because I'm almost through with these! I love this site but just a few of the instructions were a little bit hard for me to figure out but I'm in the groove now. I would like a little bit harder looking but easy doing origami though. Thank you SO much for creating this site! You really are spreading joy one fold at a time! I hope i will be uploading some pictures soon! Thanks again!

 I just wanted to write to tell you how much I love this site. Over the summer I had drivers education and had to go to work with my dad daily. I spent roughly six hours a day with him and I had nothing to do... that is until I realized there was an abundance of scrap paper laying around. I was then struck with the idea of doing origami, but didn't know how to make anything. I jumped on the internet and found this amazing site. Now, not only have I found things to do all summer stuck in an office, but I have also found an amazing hobby. Thank you for this amazing website!
