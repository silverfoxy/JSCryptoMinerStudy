I plan to sell an apartment. I am trying to calculate the current value of the property and the capital gain tax. While buying this property the agreement was made of 50 Lacs. I have the registered agreement as per the law. Apart from this, I paid 2 lacs extra to the builder for Development charges, Club house charges, service tax on development charges, service tax on club house charges, service tax on Ad hoc maintentance. Builder had provided me a separate bill for this but this 2 lacs is not included in the sales agreement. My query is: what would be the cost of acquisition? Is it 50 lacs or 52 lacs?\nThank you very much.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jonny","url":""}}]},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org\/","@type":"Article","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https:\/\/www.am22tech.com\/renew-indian-passport-usa\/"},"url":"https:\/\/www.am22tech.com\/renew-indian-passport-usa\/","headline":"Renew Indian passport in USA after 10 years Cox Kings by post","datePublished":"2014-09-25T00:23:03+00:00","dateModified":"2018-03-14T07:15:23+00:00","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","@id":"https:\/\/www.am22tech.com\/#organization","name":"Anil Gupta","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http:\/\/www.am22tech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/am22tech-logo-full-name-sharp-small.png","width":600,"height":60}},"image":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https:\/\/www.am22tech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/renew-indian-passport-in-usa-step-by-step-process.jpg","width":1024,"height":693},"articleSection":"NRI","description":"Renew Indian passport in USA after 10 years with Cox & Kings.
