trust and respect.</font></p>
<p align="left"> 
<font face="Arial">As an individual with respect for allopathic 
medicine and a passion for holistic medicine, I've come to enjoy 
Dr. Sahelian's online writings. I appreciate the 
comprehensive, accurate and up to date information he provides.
</font></p>
<p align="left"> 
<font face="Arial">Dr. Sahelian, thanks so much for your 
forthright, empirically oriented, common sense approach to the 
information you provide. Your reviews and assessments of 
supplements are most informative and useful. I always read them before trying anything new. For 
example, I found your insights on the potential insomnia effects 
of Coq10 and tyrosine to perfectly align with my own experience; 
yet no one else seems to write about this, even recommending 
300 mg or more of Coq10 per day. If I took this I wouldn’t sleep 
for days. </font></p>
<p align="left"> <strong style="font-weight: 400">
<font face="Arial">Thank you for such an informative, and most importantly, 
honest resource on supplements. You provide research with every 
review and list side effects many others don't care to.</font></strong></p>
<p align="left"> <strong style="font-weight: 400">
<font face="Arial">Thank you for changing my life and many of my 
loved ones. You are my favorite Dr. to seek answers online about 
supplements. My doctor now knows that 
whatever prescription she suggests, I will be researching 
supplements that have the same action in the body, and I seek 
your advice first. I tell others that your advice has done me 
more good than 30 years of doctors who are not willing to look 
anything up that is not in the 12 (or so) most common causes of 
fatigue.</font></strong></p>

Q.
Why do you recommend taking a &quot;vitamin supplement holiday&quot;? After all, we continue to take in vitamins daily 
from our food without apparent harm?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#000000">&nbsp;A. We ingest quite a variety of vitamins and minerals
through our diet, often in small, well balanced proportions. Many multivitamin 
supplements have high
amounts of certain vitamins and minerals and not necessarily in the same balance the body
is used to through foods. Hence, to be cautious, I find a reasonable approach is to take
breaks. Other doctors or scientists certainly have different opinions.<strong style="font-weight: 400"><br>

High dosages, such as 800 to 1,500 mg were recommended by 
doctors for many decades to women with osteoporosis, but it is 
possible that high amounts could lead to damage to blood vessels 
or increase the risk for heart attack. Limit daily intake from 
supplements to no more than 400 to 600 mg a day. <br>

<strong style="font-weight: 400"><font face="Arial">Would it be of benefit to open capsules and crush all tablets to maximize absorption of supplements or 
is this overkill?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; As a general rule this is not necessary but each capsule or tablet 
from different manufacturers is different and each person has a 
different absorption ability. Some people take several supplements or 
combinations that are excessive, or high dosages may interact negatively 
with certain prescription medications they are taking, so even if a 
little less is absorbed by not opening certain capsules or crushing 
certain tablets, perhaps the resulting potential lesser absorption is 
desirable. 
Overall though, for practical purposes, it is not necessary to open 
capsules or crush tablets unless the 
supplement is required in high dosages to treat a particular medical 
condition and the patient has difficulty with stomach acid production or 
has a history of intestinal malabsorption.</font></strong></p><center>
