				<h3>
					Cavern Of Anti-Matter &ndash; Hormone Lemonade
				</h3>
			
			<p>Cavern Of Anti-Matter journey off on a new modular motorik journey. This, the third LP from the group is another immaculately composed 70s funk regression session of liquid library sounds, minimal guitar melodies and blood drums that weave in and out of themselves to form an autobahn soundtrack as multi-tiered in layers as it is rich with swirling exotica textures.</p>
