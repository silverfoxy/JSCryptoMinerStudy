<p>So what is Thrasher's Wheat all about and why?  



<p>When we first started Thrasher's Wheat back in 1996, we were feeling overwhelmed by the flood of Neil Young information on the Internet.  When we joined the original Neil Young mailing list Rust@Death founded by <a href="http://www.svn.net/datamonk/sjmn.05.04.95.html" target="win">Dan Farmer</a>, author of the infamous SATAN** program, back in 1993, the volume of posts to RUST averaged half dozen or so a day.  By the time we headed for the Human Highway ditch, the volume on RUST had exploded to about 75 a day.  As of mid-2003, RUST@Yahoo posts are sometimes averaging over 150 posts per day. 

<p>Our original thinking at the time was to create a site for the busy reader.  A Neil Young internet portal that one could go on occasion and check in on some interesting <a href="reviews.htm">Neil Young reviews and opinions</a> of concerts, albums and films.  It was never intended to be an up to date <a href="http://www.neilyoung.com/" target="win">official</a> Neil news site or a bootlegs guide. More like a fan club page of research for  Young scholarship on a PhD that keeps us searching for a <a href="hogneil.htm">heart of gold</a>.

<p>Another motivation for this site was a firm belief that Neil Young's work deserved the in depth critical analysis that is widely accorded to Bob Dylan.  It was this investigative research on the <a href="http://www.thrasherswheat.org/jammin/dylan.htm">intersection of Bob Dylan's lyrics and Neil Young's music</a> that jump started the core of Thrasher's Wheat's archives.

<p>Around 1998, we stopped updating Thrasher's Wheat due to time constraints.  Also, we were experiencing some Neil burnout and weren't being particularly inspired by the music of the late '90's and early 21st century.  But love of Neil Young's <a href="music.htm">music</a> and <a href="songs.htm">lyrics</a> has never diminished. His unique <a href="sound.htm">sound</a> and <a href="style.htm">style</a> has become one that we have all grown to love.

<p>With the arrival of <b><a href="/2003/greendale.htm">Greendale </a></b> in 2003 -- for us -- Greendale was like a <a href="http://neilyoungnews.thrasherswheat.org/2013/09/when-neil-young-speaks-truth-to-power.html">sledgehammer to the anvil of truth</a> and awakened this blog from it's post-9/11 dormancy. Because when <a href="http://neilyoungnews.thrasherswheat.org/2013/09/when-neil-young-speaks-truth-to-power.html">Neil Young Sings Truth To Power, The World Listens</a>.

<p><b>Greendale</b> is some of Neil's most interesting material since the <a href="tnfy/swa.htm">Sleeps with Angels</a> and <a href="tnfy/mirror_ball.htm">Mirror Ball</a> era, so we have been inspired to update Thrasher's Wheat for the first time in years and to celebrate Thrasher's 10 year anniversary of joining RUST.  Similarly, sometimes folks will say "Whatever happened to Neil Young?". Well, just as Neil never went away and continues to make great music, Thrasher's Wheat is dedicated to satisfying that question. So what you have is an archive of Neil Young and Crazy Horse information.<p>

What we're trying to do is archive some of the best writing on Neil that we find on the Internet.  Whether it's a RUST, Human Highway post, Usenet post or major media publication.<p>

<p>On a side note, it seems that some folks like to write about Trasher instead of Thrasher.  Just curious about this frequent typo?  And speaking of curious things, like the urban legend about the Neil Young and Lynyrd Skynyrd feud, here's a <a href="faq.htm"><b>FAQ</b></a> of facts and trivia.  And another side note, someone recently pointed out when you click on a link on Thrasher's Wheat it becomes <A HREF="fot.htm#cits">"purple words on a gray background."</a>  Pretty cool. ;)

<p>Also, check out <a href="http://thrashersblog.com/">Thrasher's Blog, a Neil Young blog</a> and more.  Some rock-n-roll ramblings on some of my other favorite music that's been inspired and influenced by Neil like Pearl Jam, Lucinda Williams, Wilco, The Jayhawks, My Morning Jacket, and more. 

<p>In 2004, Thrasher's Wheat moved to its own domain.  While the earthlink.net domain served us well over the years, the crush of Greendale traffic caused problems on bandwidth consumption.  So we'll see how this all works out.

<p>FWIW, we were born in 1960, down by the docks of the bays. As a student of everything esoteric, we have been searching for truth all of our lives, looking to make sense of all the beauty and insanity on this earth. In that time, we have developed a holistic body here on Thrasher's Wheat from Neil Young's music and wisdom which links arts, science, philosophy and spirituality into a single framework of ever expanding understanding. We want to share what we have with the world, becoming teacher to some and student to all others. Our goal is to help ourselves and others become better music lovers and truth seekers, and with the wisdom gained in the process, make this planet EARTH the paradise it was meant to be. We are just happy to give back to a world and universe that we have received so much from as <a href="http://neilyoungnews.thrasherswheat.org/2013/12/neil-young-continues-to-answer-his-own.html">"The Big Shift"</a> approaches. namaste

<p>So if you see something interesting let me know.  In the meantime, as Neil Young says: <A HREF="fot/ritfw.htm">Keep on Rockin'</a> and <A HREF="2003/greendale_reviews.htm">Be The Rain! Be The Change ! Be The Wheat!</a>

<p>Why we do what we do?  <A HREF="http://neilyoungnews.thrasherswheat.org/2015/11/an-open-letter-to-mark-zuckerberg-ceo.html">The Big Secret reveal</a>.

<p>p.s. - Question -- What is the goal of this website? Why do we share different sources of Neil Young information that sometimes conflicts or might even be considered Neil Young "bashing". 
<p>Answer -- The primary goal of Thrasher's Wheat is to help all people become better Neil-seekers in a real-time boots-on-the-ground fashion. This is for the purpose of learning to listen and think critically, discovering the truth of music from within—not just listening to music blindly because it came from an "authoritative voice" like a Bob Dylan or Neil Young. Instead of telling you what the truth is, we share information from many sources so that you can disCERN it for yourself. We focus on teaching you the tools to become your own authority on the truth of music, gaining self-mastery, sovereignty, and freedom in the process. We want each of you to become your own leaders and masters of personal disCERNment, and as such, all information should be vetted, analyzed and disCERNed at a personal level. We also encourage you to discuss your thoughts in the comments section of this site to engage in a group disCERNment process.
