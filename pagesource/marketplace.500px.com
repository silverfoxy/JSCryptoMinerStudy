Cookies

<div class='description'>
<p>
Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our website are visited and by how many people. 500px cookies do not collect personal information, and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or e-mail address is.
</p>
<p>
The &quot;help&quot; portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. We recommend that you leave the cookies activated because cookies allow you to use some of 500px's coolest features. Some of our business partners, like our advertisers, may use cookies on our website. We have no access to, or control over, these cookies.

Sharing Your Information
</div>
<div class='description'>
<p>
Because 500px enables people to discover and share information with one another, information about the people who use 500px is an integral part of the 500px experience. Rest assured that we neither rent nor sell your personal information to anyone and that we will share your personal information only as described below.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
500px Personnel: 500px personnel and authorized consultants and/or contractors may have access to user information if necessary in the normal course of 500px business.
</li>
<li>
Business Transfers: In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if 500px, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred.
</li>
<li>
Protection of 500px and Others: We may release personal information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with a law; to enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other policies; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of 500px, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
</li>
<li>
User Profile information: Information collected during registration and subsequent visits, such as your full name and location, may be displayed to other 500px users in your User Profile. The User Profile is the area on 500px where we allow you to tell other 500px users about yourself. You may control what personal information is displayed in your User Profile by visiting the Settings section of your User Profile.
</li>
<li>
Followers' Activity: Much like other online social networks, 500px allows non-followers to browse your followers activity.
</li>
<li>
Syndication: 500px allows for the RSS syndication of all of its public content within the 500px website.
</li>
<li>
With Your Consent: Except as noted above, we will contact you when your personal information is shared with third parties or used for a purpose incompatible with the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected, and you will be able to opt out to prevent the sharing of this information.

Children Under 18 Years of Age

You must be 14 years and older to register to use the 500px website. As a result, 500px does not specifically collect information about children.

Use this form to add credits to this buyer's account. Example: credit of $1000 for the price of $750,
would mean a 25% discount and photographer payouts will be based on the $750.
</p>
<p>
If you don't know what Credit Period or Credit Duration are, leave them blank.
</p>
<p>
A buyer's currency will be automatically decided by their location. Buyers in Europe will see pricing in euros, and buyers in the rest of the world will see pricing in USD. Exception: if a buyer has a USD subscription balance, prices will always be displayed in USD.
