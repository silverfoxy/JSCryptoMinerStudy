  <div class="title">Compliment</div>
  <div class="content">
    <span class="fa fa-quote-left"></span> I have been a user of Book Collector for many years and now have over 1400 books entered. I have watched this software develop over this period of time and all of your improvement efforts have greatly increased its value to me. I have had very little need for customer support over the past 15 years or so until recently.

<p>About a month ago, I started experiencing problems with my computer. I had a section of my Hard Drive corrupted and tried to fix this with no success. The only solution was a new computer and my library software was the most important information to me on this computer. This problem was intermittent and my computer appeared to be functioning Ok at this time, so I decided to download the latest update to Book Collector thinking when I transferred it to another computer I would be better off with the latest version. Well, this is when my problems began. I found the "Search" function would no longer work and other problems were developing. I attempted to copy to my thumbdrive and had problems with this, again not the fault of Book Collector, but the problems with my computer. Finally, in desperation, I contacted your support group.

<p>I had the pleasure of working with Athan-Jon de Jager. I never expected to receive the service that he provided. Working through my computer with Teamviewer he repaired all of my files, deleted the duplicates and helped me with the installation on my new computer. He was courteous, patient and extremely knowledgeable. I am located in the United States and despite the six hour time difference he worked me into his schedule to handle all of my problems in a timely fashion. I could not have been better served.

<p>This e-mail is written to commend your support as well as compliment you on the fine library product you have developed. I could not be more pleased with the product and support.
<br>Thanks for everything and I look forward to a long and continued relationship. <span class="fa fa-quote-right"></span>

    <span class="fa fa-quote-left"></span> Just got off-line after a session with one of your techs. He took over my computer and was able to reproduce my problem and come up with a solution. (The problem wasn't with the Book Collector s/ware). He was very knowledgeable and helpful. 
<br>I don't know ANYONE else who has such a support team and I surmise that Collectorz is a small company. Well done. <span class="fa fa-quote-right"></span>
