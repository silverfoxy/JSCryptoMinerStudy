<P>In the name of the LORD, the Everlasting God<BR>
--Genesis 21,33</P>

<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Mechon Mamre</H1>

<P>Here you will find the Hebrew Bible (Tana"kh) and the RaMBaM's Complete Restatement of the Oral Law (Mishneh Torah):  Together these give God's full guidance for both Jews and Gentiles in all times and places detailing what God expects us to do and not do.  Through the study and observance of these two guides to Torah (God's instructions) we can all live richly rewarding lives and avoid painful errors.  Both our online and offline Bible and Mishneh Torah texts have been carefully prepared, and they are as accurate as found in the very finest printed editions.  (Additional materials are also provided, but they are not the heart of this site.)</P>

<P>Five free <B>online</B> resources for learning Torah:</P>

<UL>

<LI>The Complete Hebrew Bible (Tanach) in five editions in <A HREF="i/t/t0.htm">Hebrew</A> (including one with <A HREF="c/ct/c0.htm">cantillation marks</A>), <A HREF="e/et/et0.htm">English</A> (JPS 1917), <A HREF="p/pt/pt0.htm">parallel Hebrew and English</A> (voweled Hebrew and JPS English), and <A HREF="f/ft/ft0.htm">parallel Hebrew and French</A> (voweled Hebrew and Rabbinat French).  The beginning (the 5 books of the Torah plus Joshua and Judges) of a Hebrew Bible with <A HREF="i/t/a0.htm">vowels and popup commentaries</A> on difficult words and phrases.  The Torah in Aramaic (Targum Onqelos on the Five Books of Moses) <A HREF="i/t/u/u0.htm">with vowels</A> or <A HREF="i/t/k/q/q0.htm">without vowels</A> as well as a <A HREF="i/t/u/u0.htm">parallel Hebrew and Aramaic Torah</A> by weekly readings (parashiyot).  <A HREF="c/ct/cp/cp0.htm">Tiqqun Qore'im</A> with letter only text of the Torah and Megillat Esther with vowels and cantillation marks appearing when the mouse is over words and disappearing when the mouse moves off of them.</LI>

<P>We are developing additional online and offline resources for learning Torah.   Although all material on our site is copyrighted freeware, we do hope you will make a <A HREF="donation.htm" TITLE="Make a Donation to Support Our Site">donation</A>, if you can.</P>

<P>Since essentially all the content of this site is available in ZIPs, we ask that you not use a robot to download this whole site:  it is not only unnecessary, but costs us needless outlays for the added load on our server, makes the server slower for others who are online, and it would take years to read the whole site even for speed readers.</P>

<P>If you have any questions or comments, <SCRIPT TYPE="text/javascript">email('home')</SCRIPT>  We intend to answer all real (non-junk non-virus) mail within a day or two; so if you do not hear from us within three days, please write again assuming that either your letter or our answer has been lost, which is hardly rare these days.  Note that letters with attached programs that can be run (including scripts and Word DOCs) and letters with huge attachments are automatically rejected by our server; for security reasons, we only take text-based letters.  The hundreds of letters we get each month have helped us improve the site greatly, and we thank you for your on-going help:  God bless you all!</P>

<P>All of the material in this site is copyrighted.  We are often asked how we can claim a copyright in a public domain book like The Bible.  While it is quite true that no one can have a copyright that excludes all others from preparing their own unique copy of the Bible or other public domain works for copyright protection, our Bibles and other materials are not exactly like any others and are fully protected by copyright laws in all countries.  If you want to prepare your own unique Bible or other Torah materials for the Web, we are open to giving help and advice toward that end.</P>

<P>You may use materials from this site only for your private study and teaching, not for publishing in any form, including any Web site.  Under our liberal understanding of the Fair Use Doctrine, you may use a few short quotations from our site in any other work, including copyrighted publications.  Any other use requires written permission from us.</P>

<P>We expressly invite links to any of the text files on our site (but not to zips or graphics, for which you should link to our pages that link to them).  We provide detailed information on how to link to individual paragraphs and verses <A HREF="i/abouttch.htm">elsewhere</A> on this site.</P>
