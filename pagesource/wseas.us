Dear WSEAS<br>
<br>
Some years ago we gave plenary talk together with Janos Fodor.<br>
This is a special case, and for funding reason it would be important for us to 
keep two names. Please see our correspondence below.<br>
If there is a possibility to have the plenary under two names I would appreciate 
it.<br>
Best regards. Congratulations for the excellent conferences.<br>

Dear Peter,<br>
<br>
Thank you so much for your wonderful reply, your scientific appreciation for the 
WSEAS CSCC conference is very important. Actually, I think that when the 
dissemination of scholars' work is accomplished in a friendly and towering 
atmosphere then everything becomes a beautiful experience.<br>
You are an outstanding scientist, and I feel confident when I see that you have 
the same way of thinking on a conference.<br>
<br>
Here, in Romania we have a hot summer, the temperatures are very high, up to 37 
Celsius degrees. I hope you have a nice weather and you will spend a marvellous 
vacation with your dear family!<br>
<br>
Thank you so much, for everything!<br>

LETTER OF APPRECIATION for the WSEAS NAUN INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCES in Salerno, 
Italy, June 27-29, 2015<br>
<br>
Dear Salerno International Conferences Committees and Associates,<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I just returned from the conferences in Salerno, June 27-29, 2015, and want to 
take a moment to thank you for making it such a worthwhile experience. I know 
you spent many months planning the event, and it showed. I especially liked your 
selection of plenary and invited speakers.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
According to my humble knowledge, for the first time in West scientific history, 
from speakersí presentation emerged clearly, with sounding examples, the current 
paradigm shift from ìScience 1.0î to ìScience 2.0î in scientific and engineering 
applications we are experiencing even at the social level today.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Many ìScience 1.0î researchers and scientists up to scientific journals assume 
that the ultimate language of science is associated to the ìcontinuum 
hypothesisî assumption and it is even the traditional instrument of risk-taking. 
Unfortunately, deep epistemic limitations reside in some parts of the areas 
covered in risk analysis and decision making applied to real problems.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
In 1924, the fresh idea of a wave description associated to elementary discrete 
systems has emerged from a major ontological paradigm shift with respect to 
Classical Physics, which still provides the framework of the vision of Nature of 
most scientists and engineers, since 1687.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
This change of paradigm has not yet been completely grasped by contemporary 
Science and Technology, so that not all the implications of this change have 
been realized hitherto, even less their related applications. So, the fresh 
approach, developed under the îdiscreteness hypothesisî assumption, in specific 
scientific disciplines, was considered in peculiar application areas only, 
historically.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
As a matter of fact, to grasp a deeper representation of reality, researchers 
and scientists need two intelligently articulated hands: both stochastic and 
combinatorial approach synergically articulated by natural coupling; letís say 
we need a fresh îScience 2.0î approach.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Over more than three centuries, the above two large scientific research areas 
(continuum based and discreteness based) have followed separate mathematical 
development paths with no articulated synergistic coupling.<br>
<br>
That is the main reason why the ìScience 2.0î approach is still mostly 
overlooked by traditional scientific and engineering researchers for system 
multi-scale modeling, from system nanoscale to macroscale and beyond.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Unfortunately, the îprobabilistic veilî can be very opaque computationally by 
itself , in a continuum-discrete arbitrary multi-scale environment, and 
misplaced precision leads to information dissipation and confusion.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Your conferences in Salerno gave the right perspective to this major and 
fundamental problem in current Science and Engineering.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Eventually, I like to appreciate the specific contributes of Prof. Nikos 
Mastorakis, Prof Aurelio Tommasetti, Prof. Leonardo Cascini, Prof. Joseph 
Quartieri and Prof. Claudio Guarnaccia. Furthermore Dr. Anna Papadimitriou, Dr. 
Olga Nikolova and Mrs. Rayna Moskova, for their fine work, excellent planning 
and realistic scheduling that resulted in informative and smooth running 
meetings.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Next year's organizers will have their hands full trying to equal the quality of 
this year's event. Thanks for making your conferences so worthwhile.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Thanks to you and your committees, your companies and the University of Salerno 
now have an outstanding model to follow and to share for the future, towards a 
more sustainable economy and well-being, in a global competition scenario.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Best regards,<br>
<br>

I'm privilege to have your invitation. In September I have a previous<br>

See you in WSEAS Conferences in Budapest in 12-14 December 2015.<br>

Thank you again for your invitation to participate in WSEAS Conferences, Seoul, 
September 5-7, 2015.<br>
I received your reply saying that Korea is beautiful and wonderful. And to try.<br>
Well, yes, I do accept and I will change the engagements I had previously made.
<br>
&nbsp;There is only one problem. The flight I've seen most convenient to take from 
Mexico City arrives at Seoul on the 5th September at night. So, would it be 
possible to give the Plenary Talk on the 6th or 7th September and not on the 
5th, please? I would very much appreciate your answer in order to buy the ticket 
as soon as possible.<br>

Appreciating the nice WSEAS conference in SALERNO<br>
<br>
Dear Nikos<br>
Another event of most well-known international multi discipline conference of 
WSEAS happened in Salerno, Italy and <br>
I am very glad that I could participate in this high rank academic event and 
also met with you again. It is my pleasure which we pursuing our cooperation 
since 2000 and I hope this will be continued as well as it has.<br>
I saw news in TV about economic crisis in Greece and I wish it will be solved as 
soon. <br>
Greece is a historic country with a deep background of culture and an important 
geopolitics location in Europe. <br>
I attached a memorial picture from the last conference.<br>
I wish all the best and say hello to family<br>

Dear WSEAS<br>
<br>
I accept your invitation to participate in the Scientific Committee for WSEAS 
Conferences CSCC / INASE 2016.<br>
In addition I could be a conference photographer too, I just need to find a 
better camera.<br>
I heard from my Latvian colleague that in 2016 you are going to organize one 
WSEAS conference in Latvia, <br>
Is that still actual? In Latvia I really can help a lot, but I also do not mind 
to travel and work in hot countries like Greece ;-). <br>
Can you imagine that in Latvia in this July the air temperature is only 18-22C? 
Is it colder that sea temperature on Zakynthos!<br>
<br>
Best wishes,<br>
<br>
Best Regards,<br>
