random_text[number++] = "Pam, Defcon ten. Houston, we have a problem."
random_text[number++] = "Weird. Yeah, I didn't get both of your messages."
random_text[number++] = "No, it's fine.  I'm sure it must have been weird for Jim when Roy and I were joking around... that one time."
random_text[number++] = "I would never do that.  Waste of money.  In my experience, guys are way more attracted to the back of you than the front."
random_text[number++] = "I am gonna be your new boss.  It's my greatest dream come true.  Welcome to the Hotel Hell.  Check in time is now.  Check out time is never."

random_text[number++] = "I'm the owner.  The co-owner. With Satan!"
random_text[number++] = "Okay, just so I understand it, in your wildest fantasy you are in Hell and you are co-running a bed and breakfast with the devil?"
random_text[number++] = "I love fake boobs.  Often times, you find them on strippers."
random_text[number++] = "I find it offensive.  Au natural, baby.  That's how I like 'em.  Swing low, sweet chariots."
random_text[number++] = "I'll tell you this, it is not because of the boob job.  Excuse me, boob enhancement."
random_text[number++] = "That would be shallow.  And this is the opposite of shallow.  This is... emotionally magnificent."
random_text[number++] = "Cause I am what I am. ... That's Popeye."
random_text[number++] = "I agree. But in another way, I am off to a very good start, wouldn't you say?"
random_text[number++] = "I am a great interviewee. Why? Because I have something no one else has: my brain. Which I use to my advantage, when advantageous."
random_text[number++] = "Your advice was good, but Jan's was bigger."
random_text[number++] = "That is Beardy."
random_text[number++] = "Just say, 'I want to squeeze them.'  It's code.  She'll know what it means."

random_text[number++] = "Hey!  You're<i/> unstable!"
random_text[number++] = "David, I did not tell her."
random_text[number++] = "I could wear stretch pants and wait for you to come home at 5:15.  It could work.  This could work, really!"
random_text[number++] = "Why is my office black?"
random_text[number++] = "So I'm back.  And I am never, ever going to leave.  I am going nowhere."
random_text[number++] = "This place... is like... the hospital where I was born, my house, my old age home, and my... graveyard... for my bones."
random_text[number++] = "But, uh, until then... I can hold my head up. ... I'm not gay."
random_text[number++] = "Pam.  Sorry.  Um, are you free for dinner tonight?"
random_text[number++] = "All right.  Then... it's a date."
random_text[number++] = "I'm sorry, what was the question?"
random_text[number++] = "Oh no, it's bad.  It's real bad.  It's like eating a hot circle of garbage."
random_text[number++] = "No, you don't even know what stupid is.  It's about to get all stupid up in here!"
random_text[number++] = "Stanley, could you look up 'accomplices'?"
random_text[number++] = "I'm not kidnapping him, I'm keeping him until I get what I want."
random_text[number++] = "Yes, is Alfredo there?  Can I speak to a manager then?"
random_text[number++] = "We're all accomplices now anyway, so we figured we might as well eat."
random_text[number++] = "We would like to order some good pizza, from Alfredo's Pizza Cafe, while we wait for the hostage situation with the bad pizza to end."
random_text[number++] = "I stole it!"
random_text[number++] = "If anyone out there is listening, I'm being held here against my will.  I'm a minor."
random_text[number++] = "If you're going number one you've got ten more seconds!"
random_text[number++] = "Oh my God, oh my God, no, no, no.  I kidnapped a kid."
