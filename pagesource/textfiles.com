<!-- TEXTFILES.COM is a site dedicated to the Textfiles of the BBS World -->
<!-- from the 1980's. Naturally, this role expands into the continuation -->
<!-- of the textfile-writing world into the 1990's, and goes back to the -->
<!-- 1960's and 1970's as well. If you have any questions, feel free to  -->
<!-- mail them to jason@textfiles.com. Submissions are always wanted.    -->

<!-- Unlike a lot of sites, this Page Source has a lot of comments. This -->
<!-- is because this site's main purpose is education, and a user should -->
<!-- have the opportunity to see how this site was created and what the  -->
<!-- thought process was behind the look. Plus, the site weighs in at a  -->
<!-- very low size, so giving an explanation with the download is not a  -->
<!-- very bandwidth-intensive activity, and might inspire someone.       -->

<!-- Since TEXTFILES.COM harkens back to an earlier era, but is being done  -->
<!-- in the modern era, it is the usual blend of recent features and hacks  -->
<!-- to simulate older technology. In this case, everything is in green     -->
<!-- (which, believe it or not, is the light that the eye takes the longest -->
<!-- to get tired looking at) on a black screen, and the visual "hook" is   -->
<!-- the Blinking Cursor, which has disappeared in a lot of mainstream,     -->
<!-- windowed applications. This is accomplished with small animated GIFs.  -->

<!-- Now, let's make the page the usual black background and green text. -->

<BODY BGCOLOR="#000000" TEXT="00FF00" LINK="00FF00" ALINK="#00FF00" VLINK="#00FF00">

<!-- Where possible, use the courier font, which looks like old-style
     typewriter faces. Make sure that this color will be green too.      -->

    On the face of things, we seem to be merely talking about text-based files, 
    containing only the letters of the English Alphabet (and the occasional
    punctuation mark).
   
    <P>

    On deeper inspection, of course, this isn't quite the case. What this site
    offers is a glimpse into the history of writers and artists bound by the
    128 characters that the American Standard Code for Information Interchange
    (ASCII) allowed them. The focus is on mid-1980's textfiles and the world
    as it was then, but even these files are sometime retooled 1960s and 1970s
    works, and offshoots of this culture exist to this day.
