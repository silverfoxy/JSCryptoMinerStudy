					<p>Hello everyone. Let&#8217;s quickly go to the question which we have for today, It&#8217;s from Raju, Maharashtra. The question goes like this &#8220;How to get an Educational Loan in India?&#8221;</p>
<p>Getting a education loan is quite simple.</p>
<p>-> First things first - You need to select the college which you are planning to join for pursuing your UG degree. Usually there will be representatives from banks who are tied up with the colleges for taking education loan so identify them when you go to college for carrying out the admission process. Feel free to ask the college officials for the same. </p>
<p><strong>Youtube</strong>: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ag4MJ3zMY" target="_blank">How to get an education loan in India?</a></p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/p0Ag4MJ3zMY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>-> If you prefer you can go straight to the banks where your parents have an account already and talk with them about the possibilities of taking up the Education loan. </p>
<p>-> Make sure you discuss everything in detail so that you are sure about what&#8217;s the interest rate, timeline for repaying money and other formal informations.</p>
<p>My personal advice will be to pick up SBI bank for education loan because they usually have lower interest rates for education loan when compared with others.</p>
<p>To summarize, to get an education loan you need to (one) Select the college (two) Meetup the bank representatives (three) Collect complete details before accepting the loan and signing the papers.</p>

					<p>Hello everyone, today&#8217;s question is from Vikas, Delhi and he wants to know &#8220;How to join Merchant Navy?&#8221;</p>
<p>Vikas, before getting into the details let me just quickly give a basic description of what Merchant Navy is to our other viewers. So guys, Merchant Navy can be described as commercial fleet of passenger, cargo, bulk carrier, container ships and many more which are non-combatant. India has a large merchant shipping fleets which makes the career of Merchant Navy very promising.</p>
<p><strong>Now, to apply for Merchant Navy there is some basic eligibility criteria:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>You need to at least complete your 10th grade to apply at least for seafarer position.</li>
<li>Age should be 16-25 years.</li>
<li>You should be physically and mentally strong.</li>
<li>You should have a proper eyesight 6/6 without glasses and no colour blindness.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, there are two options (One) You can complete your 10th grade and then do some 1-2 years diploma course like Pre-sea Training for personnel, man Dredgers, Tugs, OSVs on N.C.V Deck or Engine and then directly apply for the job in Merchant Navy or (Two) Complete your 12th grade and join as Merchant Navy Officer which will be higher role than discussed before.</p>
<p>Now a days the competition is pretty strong for Merchant Navy Officer posts, so it will be good if you do B.E Marine <a href="http://entrance-exam.net/engineering-entrance-examinations/" class="kblinker" title="More about Engineering &raquo;">Engineering</a>, B.Sc Nautical Technology, B.Sc Nautical Science or complete B.E Mechanical/Electrical/Electronics and then apply for 1-2 years Marine Engineering course which will enable you to join Merchant Navy Officer post.</p>
<p>Hope this information will help you guys. See you next soon.</p>
