<h2>I'm listed, what do I do?</h2>
<p>
The CBL has easy self-removal.  See: <a href="lookup.cgi">
CBL Lookup AND Removal</a>
It will provide you with information on why the IP was listed, how
to correct the problem that caused the listing, and
a link to do self-removal.
The rest of these web pages are intended to help you understand
what could cause a listing, and how to diagnose/remediate the problem.
</p>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong>
The CBL expects you to resolve the problem, preferably before you
do a delisting.
If you simply delist without resolving the problem, it will almost
certainly list again.
</p>
<p>
Of late a lot of people are emailing us and simply asking us to delist
an IP address.
We can't do it more quickly than you can.
It's a LOT faster if you do it yourself.
</p>

<h2>What is the CBL?</h2>

<p> The CBL takes its source data from very large mail
server (SMTP) installations.
Some of these are pure spamtrap servers, and some are not.
</p>
<p>
The CBL only lists IPs exhibiting characteristics which
are specific to open proxies of various sorts (HTTP, socks, AnalogX,
wingate, Bagle call-back proxies etc) and dedicated Spam BOTs
(such as Cutwail, Rustock, Lethic, Kelihos, Necurs etc) which
have been abused to send spam, worms/viruses that do their own direct
mail transmission, or some types of trojan-horse or "stealth"
spamware, dictionary mail harvesters etc.
</p>

<p>The CBL does <strong>not</strong> list based upon the volume
of email from a given IP address.

<p>
The CBL also lists certain portions of botnet infrastructure, such
as Spam BOT/virus infector download web sites, botnet infected machines,
machines participating in DDOS, and other web sites or name servers 
primarily dedicated to the use of botnets.
Considerable care is taken to avoid listing IP addresses that are shared
or are likely to be shared with legitimate use, except in the
case of infector download websites, phish emission or DDOS.
</p>

<p>Our botnet detections may not necessarily directly involve the
observation of spam emission, but most botnets are at least occasionally
involved in email spam, in addition to infostealing, DDOS attacks etc.
</p>

<p>In other words, the CBL only lists IPs that have attempted email
connections to one of our servers in such a way as to indicate that
the sending IP is infected with a spam-sending virus or worm, acting
as a open proxy for the sending of spam, OR, IPs primarily used in
the operation of botnets</p>

<p>The CBL does <b>NO</b> probes.  In other words, the CBL
<b>NEVER</b> makes connections to other machines to "test" anything.</p>

<p>The CBL does <b>NOT</b> test for nor list open SMTP relays.</p>

<p>The CBL only lists individual IPs, it <b>NEVER</b> lists ranges.</p>

<p>The CBL does <b>NOT</b> care whether an IP is dynamic (NAT, PAT,
TOR, VPN etc) or not,
if connections the IP makes indicate that it's infected, it is
listed regardless.
Further details:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="nat.html">NAT Listing Policy</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="TOR">TOR/VPN/proxy Listing/delisting Policy</a>.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The CBL does <b>NOT</b> attempt to associate IP addresses to
persons or organizations, and furthermore, a CBL listing
should <b>NOT</b> be construed as accusing anyone of spamming -
virtually all listees are the victims of a virus or other compromise, not
deliberately spamming.</p>

<p>The CBL does <b>NOT</b> accept external submissions for listing.
Hence it is not possible for the CBL to be used as an instrument of
revenge (eg: "disgruntled ex-employee" or "competitor").</p>

<p> The CBL operates in an entirely automated way designed to avoid
listings due to bounces of forged spam, virus
bounces, and "real" mail servers emitting the occasional spam.
However, in some circumstances severe mail server misconfiguration
can make it look as if a mail server is infected.
</p>

<p>It does not attempt to list every possible spam source.
</p>

<p>This list is based on information believed to be reliable.  No
warranty is made that it is accurate or complete....  Use entirely at
your own risk.
</p>
<p> There is no supporting data or "evidence" file available for any given
listing, and no mechanism to ask why any given listing took place.  To
counteract this, there is an automated no-questions-asked removals
procedure allowing any affected party to delist a specific IP address
rapidly.  However, delisted IPs are relisted if new evidence of spam
activity is subsequently detected.
</p>
<p>Entries automatically expire after a period of time.  The approximate
detection time of a specific entry can be obtained from the web
interface.
</p>
<h2>What to do if you're listed/How do I get delisted?</h2>
<p>Use the <a href="lookup.cgi">lookup tool</a> it will
often give you further detail.
It gives the link to the delisting tool.</p>
<p>See the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> for more information on
how to identify and resolve a CBL listing.</p>
<h2>How to use the CBL</h2>
<p>Before using the CBL, you should read our
<a href=/tandc.html>terms and conditions.</a>
<p>The CBL can be queried in the usual way for DNS-based blocking lists,
under the name <b>cbl.abuseat.org</b>.
</p>
<p>Entries in the CBL are returned with an IP address (always 127.0.0.2) and
a TXT record containing a link to the lookup/removal pages.
</p>
<p class="note">
If you are doing a lot of CBL queries (over 10,000 queries per day) it
is best that you consider running your own local DNS server with the CBL
data.
As the CBL is part of Spamhaus (and published using the "XBL" name), you
should contact http://spamteq.com and see about obtaining the XBL zone files.
</p>
<h2>Usage WARNING</h2>
<p>We're getting a lot of reports of spurious blocking caused by sites using
the CBL to block authenticated access to smarthosts / outgoing mail servers.
<strong>THE CBL is only designed to be used on INCOMING mail, i.e. on the
hosts that your MX records point to.</strong></p>
<p>If you use the same hosts for incoming mail and smarthosting, then you
should always ensure that you exempt authenticated clients from CBL checks,
just as you would for dynamic/dialup blocklists.</p>
<p>Another way of putting this is: <strong>"Do not use the CBL to block your
own users"</strong>.</p>
